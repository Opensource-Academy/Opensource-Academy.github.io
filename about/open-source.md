# Open source

What is open source or open source software? 
Is open source for you? Can you contribute to open source? Should you?
On this page, we'll provide an answer to these questions, and more.

## Open source basics
Start by reading [this article](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) on Red Hat's [opensource.com](https://opensource.com) and you will find very clear and readable answers to such questions as:  
What is open source?  
What is open source software?  
Why do people prefer using open source software?  

## Is open source for you?
Yes. Really, just read on.

## I'm sure I have nothing to contribute to open source
This is a common misconception. This idea has it's roots in the notion that one needs to be a programmer to be able to contribute to open source (software) because open source is all about code.

However, open source (software) projects require much more than programming. Code is usualy the first thing people think of when talking about an open source project. Consider community management, writing tutorials, setting up a website, moderating a forum, contact management, organising meetups, being a spokesperson, or a very important role: testing software.

## But I'm scared that people won't like my work
We can't promise that your first line of code will be accepted, nor that your community manager efforts will lead to a sprawling community of happy contributors.

We can promise however that there must be a project that is right for you. While learning, chances are that you run into a project that you like. Possibly with an already active community, try to see where you can help, before you know it, you might end up an invaluable part of a software project. Possibly without ever writing code.

## Differentiate yourself
Becoming part of an or several open source projects is a greay way to differentiate yourself. If you happen to end up as an invaluable part of a project, be sure to let people know about this.

Update your CV and LinkedIn page. Preferably collecting some references from other community members. On GitHub it's rather common to thank contributors for their work. Linking to those messages is a great way of collecting referals.

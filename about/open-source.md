## Open-source basics

### What is open-source?

> "Generally, Open Source software is software that can be freely accessed, used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. Open source software is made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition."

### What is open-source not?

#### Open-source doesn't always mean free of charge
A common mistake when talking about open-source (software) is the assumption that open-source means 'free of charge'. This regularly encountered misconception is easily explained when looking at the word 'free'. 'Free' can either mean 'free of charge' (*gratis*) or 'free' as in 'freedom'.

When the word 'free' is used in the context of open-source, insiders usualy mean the latter; as in freedom. However, because a lot of well known open-source projects (such as [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) or [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)) are giving away their product free of charge, open-source gets often directly linked to software that is given away without charging money.

Words such as 'free, 'collaboration' and 'community' tend to wrongfully give some the impressions that open-source (software development) is either all about being cheap or rooted in altruism.

As mentioned above, open-source is not about giving away a product for free. Open-source source code means receiving (peer) reviews, receiving (user) feedback and having acces to a (possibly much larger) group of testers. Open-source does **not** dictate the business model surrounding the final product that results from an open-source project. 

#### Open-source doesn't automatically make your code or product better
Developers or companies hoping to score instant rewards by simply publishing their code will need to change their expectations.

Making source code publicly available doesn't mean instant improvements. Growing a community around a new project will require a project that others will consider 'worthy of their time' and, rather obviously, some time.

Making software with an existing userbase open-source should result in a much faster growing community than a new, therefore unknown, project.

By making a project attractive for developers, the project's community will grow faster. Providing proper documentation will not only make developers feel more welcome, it will also make it easier for a project's users to become developers.

#### Open-source software is more than desktop Linux
Some people instantly think of software such as Linux and LibreOffice (formerly OpenOffice) when they hear 'open-source'. Linux desktop usability is an often cited argument against open-source development. Once again, this notion is wrong. Not to mention that 'desktop usability' is highly subjective.

This tendency to start talking about end user products can be explained by the simple fact that a lot of people got their first taste of open-source with the release of Ubuntu or OpenOffice. It can be further explained by the simple fact that most individuals will think of consumer products when talking about computer programs in general.

It's very easy to cite succesful open-source projects that have released working and beloved consumer products. For example, a little open-source project called Firefox has changed the internet as we know and use it today.

What's much more important is realising how much open-source software is being used 'in the background' by every single human who is interacting with the internet in any form.

Open-source makes technology as we use it today possible. It's also why we want to tell you more about Linux; not because of the endless amount of fancy graphical user interfaces that have been designed. But because the practical, near constant application of this operating system in making the internet as we now know it possible.

## Why does open-source matter?
What makes open-source so important and atractive?

### Many eyeballs
Open-source source code means that users become testers.

In Eric S. Raymond's [The cathedral and the bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) he compares two [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) development models:

- The *cathedral* model: in which source code is kept between a (small group of) developer(s) and released with new software versions.

- The *bazaar* model: in which source code is constantly made publicly available through the internet.

In his thesis, Raymond propositions that ["given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law): having source code publicly available for testing, scrutiny, and experimentation means all forms of bugs will be discovered quicker.

The entire thesis is available in print and [online](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/).

### Grow your team
Open-source source code means that users can become co-developers.

Having publicly available source code that users can freely review, use and change means that some users will not only become testers, but also developers.

Contributions from the community can do more than improve source code. Going through contributions by regular contributors can be an excelent way of recruiting new team members for a project or even company.

Likewise, working in the open means that contributors automatically update their resume (for example, their GitHub profile) whenever they contribute to a project.

### Differentiate yourself
Becoming part of an or several open-source projects is a greay way to differentiate yourself. If you happen to end up as an invaluable part of a project, be sure to let people know about this.

Update your CV and LinkedIn page. Preferably collecting some references from other community members. On GitHub it's rather common to thank contributors for their work. Linking to those messages is a great way of collecting referals.


### Don't just take it from us
If you want more than just our word for it, why not ask these big players:  
- [Google](https://opensource.google.com/docs/why/)  
- [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/about/why-open-source)  
- [Canonical (Ubuntu)](https://www.ubuntu.com/community/mission)  

## Buts
People really enjoy buts, let's get a few of these *behind* us.

### But I'm sure I have nothing to contribute to open-source
This is a common misconception. This idea has it's roots in the notion that one needs to be a programmer to be able to contribute to open-source (software) because open-source is all about code.

However, open-source (software) projects require much more than programming. Code is usualy the first thing people think of when talking about an open-source project. Consider community management, writing tutorials, setting up a website, moderating a forum, contact management, organising meetups, being a spokesperson, or a very important role: testing software.

### But I'm scared that people won't like my work
We can't promise that your first line of code will be accepted, nor that your community manager efforts will lead to a sprawling community of happy contributors.

We can promise however that there must be a project that is right for you. While learning, chances are that you run into a project that you like. Possibly with an already active community, try to see where you can help, before you know it, you might end up an invaluable part of a software project. Possibly without ever writing code.

## Get started
Convinced, but unsure where to start? Have a look at [open source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/), an initiative by [GitHub](https://github.com).

If you are looking to get [started](/study/quickstart) learning, consider Open Source Academy's [open-source courses](/study).

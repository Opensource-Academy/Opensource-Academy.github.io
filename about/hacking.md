## What's a hacker?
Wikipedia defines a hacker as following:

> A computer hacker is any skilled computer expert that uses their technical knowledge to overcome a problem. While "hacker" can refer to any skilled computer programmer, the term has become associated in popular culture with a "security hacker", someone who, with their technical knowledge, uses bugs or exploits to break into computer systems.

*Source: [wikipedia.org/wiki/hacker](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/hacker)*

Note how this excerpt describes that a hacker is a `skilled computer expert`. This is the type of hacker Open Source Academy is refering to when we use the word 'hacker'.

## What's hacking?
Very much like the word 'hacker' has become synonymous with 'security hacker' in the mainstream, 'hacking' has become the generally accepted term for breaking into computer systems. We refer to this as either cracking or penetration testing.

When we use the verb 'hacking', we are usualy refering to programming or otherwise writing or modifying code or scripts to make a computer do what you want it to do.

## Why should you become a hacker?
The world needs more hackers. Open Source Academy was founded with one simple goal: make sure people understand the importance open source and the possibilities it has for them. By getting more people into open source we hope to advance technology and humanity faster.

# Learning

Can you become a hacker? How do you become a hacker? On this page, we'll provide an answer to these questions, and more.

## Becoming a hacker
Becoming a skilled computer expert isn't easy. It will take years of enthousiasticly tinkering with computers, playing with code and learning all about the many varying aspects of computing, networking, security and more.

However, getting started has never been easier. In recent years, educational options have been popping up all around the internet. Increased computing power has made running virtual open source operating systems less of a hassle. Lastly, open source operating systems are more easily available than ever (often for free).

Getting started isn't the hard part. Pulling true might be harder, however, assuming that you love what you do, you'll surely find a way.

> Just remember: becoming a hacker isn't extremely complicated. There is simply a whole lot of stuff to learn.

Opensource Academy's offers study materials to guide you through your first steps as a hacker. We don't want to dictate the way you learn, play or hack. We simply want to give you a nudge in the right direction.

Becoming a hacker means that you do not specialise on a specific subject matter. You won't focus on programming in Python. You won't even just focus on programming. You want to know more. You want to be able to do more. You want to be able to do anything.

It's important to keep your goals and priorities clear. Do you want to become a hacker? A programmer? A system administrator?

> If you opt to become a hacker, be sure to keep all of the above in mind. You'll soon find out that a lot of knowledge is transferable between programs, programming languages and tools.

Becoming a hacker means learning everything about computers and having a lot of fun doing so. If you play your cards right, you'll never work a day in your life, just play.

## Getting started
If you are not sure where to start, you can use the [quickstart](/learn/quickstart). Some tips:

### Pick up all the things
Don't stick to one thing for too long to pick up new skills. Learn how to program by writing a simple script or micro program. Upload your newly programmed code to GitHub. You will run into all kinds of problems, also known as learning possibilities.

### Get to know the tools of the trade
By the time you finally got your code on GitHub, you will have used many interlinking subjects. Use guides to continue learning. Pay attention to what parts of your workflow you dislike and improve those. Get a better understanding of tools such as programs.

### Lazy means good
Repeating yourself is nice to learn things at first, but learn how to use programs and write scripts, to simplefy or automate most things.

### You are not alone
Many have gone down a path like the one you are aiming to go down now. Keep this in mind: most problems you will run into have previously been solved by others. Look for those solutions.

### Your problem is probably not unique
As an absolute beginner, it's highly unlikely that you are running into a super unique bug. Something is probably wrong on your end, keep calm and you'll surely work it out.

## Embrace failure
Prepare yourself to fail. Often. Possibly spectacularly.

In most school systems failure is considered a bad thing. As such, most people will try everything in their power to prevent themselves from failing at something. The most common way of preventing failure is not doing something, or simply giving up.

Missing out on faillures means missing out on invaluable learning experiences. Failing is a great way to learn. Consider someone who never creates backup copies of their most important files at work. Telling this person to back up data will probably have no to little effect. However, as soon as this person drops their computer and get's in trouble with their boss, they will probably start making daily backup copies.

Emracing failure means that you are prepared to fail. Being prepared means that you know that it is possible that something goes wrong and that you are prepared to spend the time and effort to solve the problem. This might also mean that you timely ask for help.

Failing means that you will be challenged to look at something again. Chances are that you will learn much more from making a huge mistake than from reading tons of tutorials and guides.

Do keep in mind however, that it is ok to admit that you do now know something (yet). Being honest about what you know and don't know will allow others to give you more room for failure.

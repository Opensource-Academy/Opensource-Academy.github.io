## More than programming

---
Ever thought of testing, writing documentation or otherwise helping out with an open-source project?

Maybe pick up programming, write an app, build a website or possibly contribute to Open Source Academy's study materials?

---
## For everyone

---
Open Source Academy Meetups are intended for everyone interested in open-source and open-source related things.

Bring some friends or make new friends to learn about or work on open-source related stuff.

Work together, learn together, at the same time, at the same place.
